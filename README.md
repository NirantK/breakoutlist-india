## Breakout List - India
```
What company should I join?

“If you join a company, my general advice is 
to join a company on a breakout trajectory.”

— Sam Altman, President at Y Combinator
```

### Why? 

The Original [Breakout List](https://breakoutlist.com/)-US has been used by thousands of engineers to identify great companies to join.

It focusses on United States based companies and not all great engineers can move there.  Thanks to Sir Obama and Trump, lot of good engineering companies have opened Indian offices recently or started taking Indian markets more seriously.

We've curated some of these high tech companies, Indian or not, but doing software engineering in India.
