## Breakout List - India
```
What company should I join?

“If you join a company, my general advice is to join a company on a breakout trajectory.”

— Sam Altman, President at Y Combinator
```
### Why? 

The Original [Breakout List](https://breakoutlist.com/) has been used by thousands of engineers to identify great companies to join.
But it focusses on US based companies and not all great engineers can move to US. We talk about high tech companies, Indian or not, but doing engineering in India.
